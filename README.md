A unified management service for app &amp; games so you can focus on what you do best, creating your content

Run your games more efficiently while saving development resources by harnessing operations tools like authentication, payment, and more.

Nbase Unity SDK accelerates game development and optimizes the use of resources during the development. The SDK provides pre-built game functionalities, such as social logins and authentication, in-app payment, chat, push messaging, user support, leaderboard, and more, for game studios to quickly and easily embed those in the games, minimizing the time and resources needed during the development cycle. After development, companies can utilize the dashboard to view game data, run queries for analytics, and operate game functionalities.
